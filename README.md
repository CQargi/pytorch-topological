# `pytorch-topological`: A topological machine learning framework for `pytorch`

`pytorch-topological` (or `torch_topological`) is a topological machine
learning framework for [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org). It aims to
collect *loss terms* and *neural network layers* in order to simplify
building the next generation of topology-based machine learning tools.

`torch_topological` is still a work in progress. Stay tuned for more
information.
